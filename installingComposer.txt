1 - go to composer's web site > Downloads:
https://getcomposer.org/download/

2 - Download the latest snapshot and place it on the project's base directory.

3 - create a file named "composer.json" with the following structure (code between dashed lines):
        composer.json
--------------------------------
      {
        "autoload": {},
        "require": {}
      }
--------------------------------

Where autoload holds the names of the classes you want to load automatically.
And require holds the names of the packages/libraries required by the project.

4 - Go to the terminal and enter these commands:
  $ sudo apt install php7.0-cli  #(only if you don't have php installed)
  $ php composer.phar install
